I use\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodarkooperativet.blackplayerex&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1\">BlackPlayer EX</a>\non Android to listen to my music.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge with Bandcamp is that there is friction between\npurchasing the digital album and then getting it loaded onto my\nAndroid. The only real supported path to downloading the .zip file\nof mp3's is to use Bandcamp's desktop site, and involves a mildly\ninfuriating process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up your Bandcamp collection</li>\n<li>Click the download link of your chosen album</li>\n<li>Click the download link on the download page</li>\n<li>Wait for the slow Bandcamp download</li>\n<li>Extract the contents of the .zip archive</li>\n<li>Copy the files to smartphone</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To add insult to injury, I use MacOS as my desktop OS, and for the life of me\nI cannot figure out how to copy files over USB from MacOS to Android.\nYes, I know about the Android File Transfer app, but it doesn't seem to\nrecognize my device.</p>\n<p>So I'm left with Windows, which is where our technical fun begins.</p>\n<p>My goal is to automate steps 1 through 5 above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automating-the-downloads\" tabindex=\"-1\">Automating the downloads <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-04-06.01.bandcamp-downloads/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Steps 1 through 4 can be easily automated with the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/easlice/bandcamp-downloader\">bandcamp-downloader</a>\nthat you can get from github.</p>\n<p>On Windows, I wanted to create a simple .bat script so that I didn't\nhave to remember the specific <code>bandcamp-downloader.py</code> command to run\nevery time. Here's my script:</p>\n<pre><code>python c:\\Users\\mike\\code\\bandcamp-downloader\\bandcamp-downloader.py ^\n  kindohm ^\n  --download-since 2020-01-01 ^\n  --directory c:\\Users\\mike\\bandcamp-downloaded ^\n  --filename-format &quot;{artist}.{title}&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>EASY.</p>\n<h3 id=\"unzipping-the-archives\" tabindex=\"-1\">Unzipping the archives <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-04-06.01.bandcamp-downloads/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Then things got a little trickier. I don't know Windows batch file\nscripting very well. Anyway, this script will then loop through\nall .zip files in the download directory, create a new directory for\neach individual archive, and unzip the archive to the new directory:</p>\n<pre><code>for /R &quot;C:\\Users\\mike\\bandcamp-downloaded&quot; %%I in (&quot;*.zip&quot;) do (\n  mkdir &quot;%%~dpnI&quot;\n  &quot;tar&quot; -xf &quot;%%~fI&quot; -C &quot;%%~dpnI&quot;\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find that <code>tar</code> ships on Windows 11.</p>\n<p>I had to do some digging to figure out how to come up with the right\narguments to <code>mkdir</code> to create the directory before unzipping:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir &quot;%%~dpnI&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>d</code> == drive letter</li>\n<li><code>p</code> == parent directory</li>\n<li><code>n</code> == file name without extension</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-enhancements\" tabindex=\"-1\">Future Enhancements <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-04-06.01.bandcamp-downloads/\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>delete the .zip files upon successful archive extraction</li>\n<li>automatically copy to phone</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-04-06.01.bandcamp-downloads/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>So now I can just run these scripts whenever I want to refresh my\nlocal Bandcamp library.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I still have to manually copy the unzipped files to\nmy smartphone by hand, but that ain't so bad.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I've been inspired recently to try and exclusively use hardware\n(synthesizers) for making music. This is quite a change for me\nsince my past processes have involved the use of a computer with\nvery unconventional tooling (no DAW, just code).</p>\n<img src=\"https://kindohm.com/img/c00f9I7hwG-600.png\" alt=\"Elektron Analog RYTM and Syntakt\">\n<p>This is what I came up with in my first experiment:</p>\n<p><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\">\n<a href=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\">download</a>\n</audio></p>\n<p>My ultimate goal is to craft a hardware setup that is like a sandbox\nto play in. I want to maximize the improvisational capabilities of\nmy machines and be able to command them quickly.</p>\n<p>This is harder than it sounds![1]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Elektron sequencers are deep</li>\n<li>Syntakt sound design is challenging</li>\n<li>I have to create many patterns for the variation I desire</li>\n<li>I use two machines which have similar yet different interfaces</li>\n<li>Figuring out how to play</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"elektron-sequencers-are-deep\" tabindex=\"-1\">Elektron sequencers are deep <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I will always say that TidalCycles is king for sequencing, but\nthe Elektron sequencers are a close second. They are so deep!\nThe parameter locking and per-step trigger conditions (e.g. fill,\nno fill, probability, step modulus, etc) let me achieve much\nof the chaos and variation I crave.</p>\n<p>One of the features on the RYTM is &quot;accent&quot;, which lets you\nadd yet another type of variation on a step. I've never used this\nfeature before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"syntakt-sound-design-is-challenging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Syntakt sound design is challenging <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It took me years to really get comfortable with the nuance of\nsound design on the RYTM. It's a deeper synth than it appears\nto be. If you combine its sample layering then you can really\nachieve a lot of unique sounds.</p>\n<p>On the Syntakt I feel like I am still a beginner. I guess\nI just haven't found my &quot;voice&quot; on that synth yet. I fear that\nit's going to take me years of hands-on practice with it on\na nearly daily basis (just like on the RYTM) to finally\nget comfortable with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"many-many-many-patterns\" tabindex=\"-1\">many many many patterns <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I like a lot of variation in my music. I rarely want the same\nsequence to play more than one or twice in a row. The Elektron\nsequencer can help fake out your ears by adding variation per\nstep, but the real solution is creating entirely different\npatterns and changing between them on the fly.</p>\n<p>This is a good solution, but takes a lot more time to assemble.\nThe only real feasible way to do it on the Elektron synths is\nto <em>copy</em> patterns. Good luck trying to create each pattern\nfrom scratch!</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-machines-similar-but-different\" tabindex=\"-1\">two machines, similar but different <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The RYTM and Syntakt are very similar in their interfaces. They\nboth have a similar LED display with a consistent presentation\nof eight synth parameters per voice. Their sequencers are programmed\nin the same way.</p>\n<p>But that's kind of where the similarities end.</p>\n<p>The two machines differ in how you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mute/umute parts</li>\n<li>change patterns</li>\n<li>use performance macros to make wholesale changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a bit of cognative overload when operating both\nmachines at the same time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"figuring-out-how-to-play\" tabindex=\"-1\">Figuring out how to play <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm too accustomed to improvising in TidalCycles code.</p>\n<p>&quot;Playing&quot; on the Elektron machines is not natural to me (yet).\nI'm still developing some muscle memory for certain actions,\nand I need to read the manuals some more.</p>\n<p>The two big objectives I have here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>craft a performance arc</li>\n<li>know how to steer the machines into chaotic territory and then rein them back in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] if I were making techno it'd be a lot easier!</p>\n",
