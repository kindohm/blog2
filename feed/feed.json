			"content_html": "<p>I've been inspired recently to try and exclusively use hardware<br>\n(synthesizers) for making music. This is quite a change for me<br>\nsince my past processes have involved the use of a computer with<br>\nvery unconventional tooling (no DAW, just code).</p>\n<img src=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/img/c00f9I7hwG-600.png\" alt=\"Elektron\" Analog=\"\" RYTM=\"\" and=\"\" Syntakt=\"\">\n<p>This is what I came up with in my first experiment:</p>\n<p><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\"><br>\n<a href=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\">download</a><br>\n</audio></p>\n<p>My ultimate goal is to craft a hardware setup that is like a sandbox<br>\nto play in. I want to maximize the improvisational capabilities of<br>\nmy machines and be able to command them quickly.</p>\n<p>This is harder than it sounds![1]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Elektron sequencers are deep</li>\n<li>Syntakt sound design is challenging</li>\n<li>I have to create many patterns for the variation I desire</li>\n<li>I use two machines which have similar yet different interfaces</li>\n<li>Figuring out how to play</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"elektron-sequencers-are-deep\" tabindex=\"-1\">Elektron sequencers are deep <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I will always say that TidalCycles is king for sequencing, but<br>\nthe Elektron sequencers are a close second. They are so deep!<br>\nThe parameter locking and per-step trigger conditions (e.g. fill,<br>\nno fill, probability, step modulus, etc) let me achieve much<br>\nof the chaos and variation I crave.</p>\n<p>One of the features on the RYTM is &quot;accent&quot;, which lets you<br>\nadd yet another type of variation on a step. I've never used this<br>\nfeature before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"syntakt-sound-design-is-challenging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Syntakt sound design is challenging <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It took me years to really get comfortable with the nuance of<br>\nsound design on the RYTM. It's a deeper synth than it appears<br>\nto be. If you combine its sample layering then you can really<br>\nachieve a lot of unique sounds.</p>\n<p>On the Syntakt I feel like I am still a beginner. I guess<br>\nI just haven't found my &quot;voice&quot; on that synth yet. I fear that<br>\nit's going to take me years of hands-on practice with it on<br>\na nearly daily basis (just like on the RYTM) to finally<br>\nget comfortable with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"many-many-many-patterns\" tabindex=\"-1\">many many many patterns <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I like a lot of variation in my music. I rarely want the same<br>\nsequence to play more than one or twice in a row. The Elektron<br>\nsequencer can help fake out your ears by adding variation per<br>\nstep, but the real solution is creating entirely different<br>\npatterns and changing between them on the fly.</p>\n<p>This is a good solution, but takes a lot more time to assemble.<br>\nThe only real feasible way to do it on the Elektron synths is<br>\nto <em>copy</em> patterns. Good luck trying to create each pattern<br>\nfrom scratch!</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-machines-similar-but-different\" tabindex=\"-1\">two machines, similar but different <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The RYTM and Syntakt are very similar in their interfaces. They<br>\nboth have a similar LED display with a consistent presentation<br>\nof eight synth parameters per voice. Their sequencers are programmed<br>\nin the same way.</p>\n<p>But that's kind of where the similarities end.</p>\n<p>The two machines differ in how you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mute/umute parts</li>\n<li>change patterns</li>\n<li>use performance macros to make wholesale changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a bit of cognative overload when operating both<br>\nmachines at the same time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"figuring-out-how-to-play\" tabindex=\"-1\">Figuring out how to play <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm too accustomed to improvising in TidalCycles code.</p>\n<p>&quot;Playing&quot; on the Elektron machines is not natural to me (yet).<br>\nI'm still developing some muscle memory for certain actions,<br>\nand I need to read the manuals some more.</p>\n<p>The two big objectives I have here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>craft a performance arc</li>\n<li>know how to steer the machines into chaotic territory and then rein them back in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] if I were making techno it'd be a lot easier!</p>\n",
