			"content_html": "<p>A bit of info about how I built this blog:</p>\n<h3 id=\"static-site-generator\" tabindex=\"-1\">static site generator <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-02-27.02.this-blog/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm using <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>\nfor static site generation. I've been a fan of 11ty for a while\nand was already familiar with it, so I just kept using it.</p>\n<p>There isn't much to the site! I want to say that the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kindohm/blog2/tree/main\">source code</a>\nspeaks for itself ðŸ¤·, but that's kinda disingenuous.</p>\n<p>I wanted this blog to be ultra simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make it more like a linear journal</li>\n<li>don't bother with navigation until necessary</li>\n<li>just make it look like a text file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following those principles, my 11ty structure is pretty basic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>content in a <code>content</code> folder</li>\n<li>posts/entries in a <code>content/blog</code> folder</li>\n<li>trivial HTML shell layout in <code>_includes/layout.njk</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also added <a href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/rss.xml\">rss</a> and <a href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/atom.xml\">atom</a>\nfeeds using the <code>@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss</code> library.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-screen-sizes\" tabindex=\"-1\">mobile / screen sizes <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-02-27.02.this-blog/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>There's no nav, columns, or anything funky about the layout here, so\nit just fine on a mobile screen out of the box:</p>\n<img src=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/img/BUy4_ydavp-600.png\" alt=\"mobile\" view=\"\">\n<h3 id=\"colocated-images\" tabindex=\"-1\">colocated images <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-02-27.02.this-blog/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Colocating images with posts in Eleventy wasn't intuitive to figure\nout. I referenced these items to accomplish it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gfscott.com/blog/eleventy-img-without-central-image-directory/\">Using the Eleventy Image plugin without a central image folder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#asynchronous-shortcode\">Eleventy image shortcode</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"build-deploy-hosting\" tabindex=\"-1\">build/deploy/hosting <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-02-27.02.this-blog/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The source code for this blog is located on github.com, so I'm just using github actions\nand a <code>gh-pages</code> branch to host the site.</p>\n<p>Building a static site with a <code>yarn</code> command is pretty trivial in a github action. After that,\nyou can publish it to a <code>gh-pages</code> branch with the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3</code> action:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Eleventy Build\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">branches</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> main\n<span class=\"token key atrule\">jobs</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">build-to-gh-pages-branch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">runs-on</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> ubuntu<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>latest\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">steps</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> actions/checkout@v2\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Setup Node\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> actions/setup<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>node@v1\n        <span class=\"token key atrule\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">node-version</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"20.x\"</span>\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">run</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> yarn\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">run</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> yarn run build<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>prod\n\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> Deploy\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">uses</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> peaceiris/actions<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>gh<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>pages@v3\n            <span class=\"token key atrule\">with</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n                <span class=\"token key atrule\">deploy_key</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> $\n                <span class=\"token key atrule\">publish_dir</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> ./_site</code></pre>\n<p><s>Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to get fenced code blocks\nto render correctly when they have blank lines.</s></p>\n",

I also love backpacking/camping/hiking\nand I try to be a better chef every day.</p>\n<p>I don't know if I have much to say here on this blog, but yet\nI also feel like I have a story to tell. Or maybe this'll just\nbe a dump for bits that I don't want to forget.</p>\n<p>Back in the 2000's I ran my own blog that ran on .TEXT\nand then <a href=\"https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/announcing-subtext.aspx/\">Subtext</a>.\nI amassed over 1000 posts on that blog but I eventually abandoned it.</p>\n<p>I currently work as a software engineer, doing a lot of React\nand nodejs work. Prior to my javascript-centric life I did a\nlot of .NET dev with c#. The one constant has been the web though,\nand I don't really care much about what language I use as long\nas I'm productive.</p>\n<p>Creative coding is more fun than work coding, which is where\nmy musical side comes in. I compose and perform music using\nthe <a href=\"https://tidalcycles.org\">TidalCycles</a>\nlivecoding environment. TidalCycles, or just &quot;Tidal&quot;, allows\nyou to sequence samples, or sequence synthesizers over MIDI.\nTidal is the end all sequencer that can do nearly anything\nyou can imagine.</p>\n<p>In my musical endeavors I've been lucky to have traveled and\nperformed in the USA and internationally in Europe and Canada.\nI've performed at events like the Algorithmic Art Assembly\n(San Francisco), Sound of Stockholm, the International\nConference on Computer Music (Limerick), Algomech (Sheffield),\namong others.</p>\n<p>Not sure where this blog is going to take me. Expect anything:\na breadth of topics; posts ranging from one sentence to\nmany paragraphs. No idea what to expect.</p>\n",
