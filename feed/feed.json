At least for me, I end up\nlearning things along the way that I can apply to my\nmore comfortable processes.</p>\n<p>The same goes for computer programming. For example,\nwhen you learn a new programming language, sometimes\nthat new language's features or programming\nparadigm influence how you write code in your\nregular programming language.</p>\n<p>anyway, I'm back at the computer, making music with\nTidalCycles, the Harmor VST, and a drum machine.\nit's my bread and butter, and it feels so good to do.\nI guess the extreme sequencing and sounds I can\ncreate with this toolchain just suits my tastes.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I've been inspired recently to try and exclusively use hardware\n(synthesizers) for making music. This is quite a change for me\nsince my past processes have involved the use of a computer with\nvery unconventional tooling (no DAW, just code).</p>\n<img src=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/img/c00f9I7hwG-600.png\" alt=\"Elektron\" Analog=\"\" RYTM=\"\" and=\"\" Syntakt=\"\">\n<p>This is what I came up with in my first experiment:</p>\n<p><audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\">\n<a href=\"https://kindohm.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/blog-assets/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/2024-02-29.mp3\">download</a>\n</audio></p>\n<p>My ultimate goal is to craft a hardware setup that is like a sandbox\nto play in. I want to maximize the improvisational capabilities of\nmy machines and be able to command them quickly.</p>\n<p>This is harder than it sounds![1]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Elektron sequencers are deep</li>\n<li>Syntakt sound design is challenging</li>\n<li>I have to create many patterns for the variation I desire</li>\n<li>I use two machines which have similar yet different interfaces</li>\n<li>Figuring out how to play</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"elektron-sequencers-are-deep\" tabindex=\"-1\">Elektron sequencers are deep <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I will always say that TidalCycles is king for sequencing, but\nthe Elektron sequencers are a close second. They are so deep!\nThe parameter locking and per-step trigger conditions (e.g. fill,\nno fill, probability, step modulus, etc) let me achieve much\nof the chaos and variation I crave.</p>\n<p>One of the features on the RYTM is &quot;accent&quot;, which lets you\nadd yet another type of variation on a step. I've never used this\nfeature before.</p>\n<h3 id=\"syntakt-sound-design-is-challenging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Syntakt sound design is challenging <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It took me years to really get comfortable with the nuance of\nsound design on the RYTM. It's a deeper synth than it appears\nto be. If you combine its sample layering then you can really\nachieve a lot of unique sounds.</p>\n<p>On the Syntakt I feel like I am still a beginner. I guess\nI just haven't found my &quot;voice&quot; on that synth yet. I fear that\nit's going to take me years of hands-on practice with it on\na nearly daily basis (just like on the RYTM) to finally\nget comfortable with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"many-many-many-patterns\" tabindex=\"-1\">many many many patterns <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I like a lot of variation in my music. I rarely want the same\nsequence to play more than one or twice in a row. The Elektron\nsequencer can help fake out your ears by adding variation per\nstep, but the real solution is creating entirely different\npatterns and changing between them on the fly.</p>\n<p>This is a good solution, but takes a lot more time to assemble.\nThe only real feasible way to do it on the Elektron synths is\nto <em>copy</em> patterns. Good luck trying to create each pattern\nfrom scratch!</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-machines-similar-but-different\" tabindex=\"-1\">two machines, similar but different <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The RYTM and Syntakt are very similar in their interfaces. They\nboth have a similar LED display with a consistent presentation\nof eight synth parameters per voice. Their sequencers are programmed\nin the same way.</p>\n<p>But that's kind of where the similarities end.</p>\n<p>The two machines differ in how you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mute/umute parts</li>\n<li>change patterns</li>\n<li>use performance macros to make wholesale changes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a bit of cognative overload when operating both\nmachines at the same time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"figuring-out-how-to-play\" tabindex=\"-1\">Figuring out how to play <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://kindohm.com/blog2/blog/2024/2024-03-01.01.hardware-vs-computer/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm too accustomed to improvising in TidalCycles code.</p>\n<p>&quot;Playing&quot; on the Elektron machines is not natural to me (yet).\nI'm still developing some muscle memory for certain actions,\nand I need to read the manuals some more.</p>\n<p>The two big objectives I have here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>craft a performance arc</li>\n<li>know how to steer the machines into chaotic territory and then rein them back in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] if I were making techno it'd be a lot easier!</p>\n",
