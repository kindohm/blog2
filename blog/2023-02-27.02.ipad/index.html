    <p>One thing i wanted to try was creating posts on the iPad.</p>
<p>I'm using the Termius app to ssh into my server, where i can
author posts and fully interact with the repo.</p>
<p>I also tried the iSh app on iOS, which is basically Alpine
linux on iPad, but was too bare bones for my liking.</p>
