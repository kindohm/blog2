title: the computer feels good
---

welp I'm back to making music on the computer for
the time being ðŸ˜…

I think it's healthy for creative types to step outside
of their comfort zone and try new things that don't
necessarily feel natural. At least for me, I end up
learning things along the way that I can apply to my
more comfortable processes.

The same goes for computer programming. For example,
when you learn a new programming language, sometimes
that new language's features or programming
paradigm influence how you write code in your
regular programming language.

anyway, I'm back at the computer, making music with
TidalCycles, the Harmor VST, and a drum machine.
it's my bread and butter, and it feels so good to do.
I guess the extreme sequencing and sounds I can
create with this toolchain just suits my tastes.
