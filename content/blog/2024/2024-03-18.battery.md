My battery pack arrived last week but it's been too
annoyingly chilly and windy to get out. Terrible excuse,
but I didn't really want to deal with wind noise on
my H1n or figure out my field improv setup in the midst
of snow gusts.

Suffice to say, I tried out my setup in the kitchen
and it works 🤙🏻
