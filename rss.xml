                <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m Mike. I&#39;ve been a software engineer since 1998. My
biggest interest in life is making experimental music with
electronics and computers. I also love backpacking/camping/hiking
and I try to be a better chef every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if I have much to say here on this blog, but yet
I also feel like I have a story to tell. Or maybe this&#39;ll just
be a dump for bits that I don&#39;t want to forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 2000&#39;s I ran my own blog that ran on .TEXT
and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/announcing-subtext.aspx/&quot;&gt;Subtext&lt;/a&gt;.
I amassed over 1000 posts on that blog but I eventually abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently work as a software engineer, doing a lot of React
and nodejs work. Prior to my javascript-centric life I did a
lot of .NET dev with c#. The one constant has been the web though,
and I don&#39;t really care much about what language I use as long
as I&#39;m productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative coding is more fun than work coding, which is where
my musical side comes in. I compose and perform music using
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tidalcycles.org/&quot;&gt;TidalCycles&lt;/a&gt;
livecoding environment. TidalCycles, or just &amp;quot;Tidal&amp;quot;, allows
you to sequence samples, or sequence synthesizers over MIDI.
Tidal is the end all sequencer that can do nearly anything
you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my musical endeavors I&#39;ve been lucky to have traveled and
performed in the USA and internationally in Europe and Canada.
I&#39;ve performed at events like the Algorithmic Art Assembly
(San Francisco), Sound of Stockholm, the International
Conference on Computer Music (Limerick), Algomech (Sheffield),
among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure where this blog is going to take me. Expect anything:
a breadth of topics; posts ranging from one sentence to
many paragraphs. No idea what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
