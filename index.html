  <p>A bit of info about how I built this blog:</p>
<h3>static site generator</h3>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>
for static site generation. I've been a fan of 11ty for a while
and was already familiar with it, so I just kept using it.</p>
<p>There isn't much to the site! I want to say that the
<a href="https://github.com/kindohm/blog2/tree/main">source code</a>
speaks for itself ðŸ¤·, but that's kinda disingenuous.</p>
<p>I wanted this blog to be ultra simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>make it more like a linear journal</li>
<li>don't bother with navigation until necessary</li>
<li>just make it look like a text file</li>
</ul>
<p>Following those principles, my 11ty structure is pretty basic:</p>
<ul>
<li>content in a <code>content</code> folder</li>
<li>posts/entries in a <code>content/blog</code> folder</li>
<li>trivial HTML shell layout in <code>_includes/layout.njk</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I also added <a href="/blog2/rss.xml">rss</a> and <a href="/blog2/atom.xml">atom</a>
feeds using the <code>@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss</code> library.</p>
<h3>mobile / screen sizes</h3>
<p>There's no nav, columns, or anything funky about the layout here, so
it just fine on a mobile screen out of the box:</p>
<p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/blog2/blog/2023-02-27.02.this-blog/BUy4_ydavp-300.webp 300w, /blog2/blog/2023-02-27.02.this-blog/BUy4_ydavp-600.webp 600w" sizes="30em"><img alt="mobile view" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog2/blog/2023-02-27.02.this-blog/BUy4_ydavp-300.jpeg" width="600" height="416" srcset="/blog2/blog/2023-02-27.02.this-blog/BUy4_ydavp-300.jpeg 300w, /blog2/blog/2023-02-27.02.this-blog/BUy4_ydavp-600.jpeg 600w" sizes="30em"></picture></p>
<h3>colocated images</h3>
<p>Colocating images with posts in Eleventy wasn't intuitive to figure
out. I referenced these items to accomplish it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gfscott.com/blog/eleventy-img-without-central-image-directory/">Using the Eleventy Image plugin without a central image folder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#asynchronous-shortcode">Eleventy image shortcode</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>build/deploy/hosting</h3>
<p>The source code for this blog is located on github.com, so I'm just using github actions
and a <code>gh-pages</code> branch to host the site.</p>
<p>Building a static site with a <code>yarn</code> command is pretty trivial in a github action. After that,
you can publish it to a <code>gh-pages</code> branch with the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3</code> action:</p>
<pre><code>const x = () =&gt; {
  return 'blah';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to get fenced code blocks
to render correctly when they have blank lines.</p>

  <p>One thing i wanted to try was creating posts on the iPad.</p>
<p>I'm using the Termius app to ssh into my server, where i can
author posts and fully interact with the repo.</p>
<p>I also tried the iSh app on iOS, which is basically Alpine
linux on iPad, but was too bare bones for my liking.</p>

  <p>I'm Mike. I've been a software engineer since 1998. My
biggest interest in life is making experimental music with
electronics and computers. I also love backpacking/camping/hiking
and I try to be a better chef every day.</p>
<p>I don't know if I have much to say here on this blog, but yet
I also feel like I have a story to tell. Or maybe this'll just
be a dump for bits that I don't want to forget.</p>
<p>Back in the 2000's I ran my own blog that ran on .TEXT
and then <a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/announcing-subtext.aspx/">Subtext</a>.
I amassed over 1000 posts on that blog but I eventually abandoned it.</p>
<p>I currently work as a software engineer, doing a lot of React
and nodejs work. Prior to my javascript-centric life I did a
lot of .NET dev with c#. The one constant has been the web though,
and I don't really care much about what language I use as long
as I'm productive.</p>
<p>Creative coding is more fun than work coding, which is where
my musical side comes in. I compose and perform music using
the <a href="https://tidalcycles.org">TidalCycles</a>
livecoding environment. TidalCycles, or just &quot;Tidal&quot;, allows
you to sequence samples, or sequence synthesizers over MIDI.
Tidal is the end all sequencer that can do nearly anything
you can imagine.</p>
<p>In my musical endeavors I've been lucky to have traveled and
performed in the USA and internationally in Europe and Canada.
I've performed at events like the Algorithmic Art Assembly
(San Francisco), Sound of Stockholm, the International
Conference on Computer Music (Limerick), Algomech (Sheffield),
among others.</p>
<p>Not sure where this blog is going to take me. Expect anything:
a breadth of topics; posts ranging from one sentence to
many paragraphs. No idea what to expect.</p>
